# Project Proposal
In this project, we'll be working as a data analyst for a prominent real estate investment firm. Our task is to conduct in-depth research and provide expert insights to a high-profile client who is looking to invest in residential properties.
Our client wants to know which cities or regions have the highest potential for a profitable real estate investment.
Here's what your project entails:
1.	Data Collection: Utilize the Real Estate Data API to extract and aggregate a year's worth of comprehensive data on residential property sales, population growth, job market statistics, and other relevant factors for specific cities or areas of interest.
   a.	Target cities: Austin, New York, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Memphis, Denver, Las Vegas (depending on where we find adequate data)
   b.	Residential property sales (ideally over time)
   c.	Population growth
   d.	Job market stats – unemployment, top job types
   e.	Property Tax / State Income Tax
   f.	Potentially include rental data
2.	Market Trends: Analyze the data to identify cities or regions where property prices have been steadily increasing over the past year. Uncover hidden gems with untapped potential that could yield significant returns for your client.
   a.	Are there any cities that stand out not included in target list?
   b.	Within target list:
     i.	Are property sales trending up or down (quantity and price)? Potentially include rental data
     ii.	How do property tax and state income tax compare?
     iii.	How does population growth compare?
     iv.	How does unemployment compare?
     v.	What type of jobs are most common?
3.	Demographic Analysis: Dig deeper into the demographic data provided by the API to understand the local population's preferences, buying behavior, and trends. Determine how these factors could impact future property values and demand.
   a.	Income
     i.	How does income distribution compare?
   b.	Size of house (# of rooms or sq. footage – not sure what is available)
     i.	Is there a trend over time by size?
4.	Risk Assessment: Crime Analysis 
   a  .	What are crime trends?
     i.	Violent crime
     ii.	Property Crime
5.	Recommendations: Based on our thorough analysis, provide well-founded recommendations to our client on which cities or areas are the most promising for real estate investment. Back your suggestions with concrete data-driven evidence to instill confidence in your findings.
